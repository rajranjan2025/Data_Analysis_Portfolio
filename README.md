# World Happiness Report 2024 - Exploratory Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **World Happiness Report 2024**. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing national happiness and uncover statistical insights using Python.

## Files in This Repository
- **`world-happiness-report-2024-analysis.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook containing the complete data analysis.
- **`world-happiness-report-2024-analysis.pdf`** - PDF version of the analysis for easy readability.
- **`summary-report.pdf`** - A structured summary highlighting key findings and insights.
- **Dataset Source:** [Kaggle - World Happiness Report 2024](<insert-dataset-link-here>)

## üìä Analysis Highlights
- **Dataset:** Covers **143 countries** with happiness scores and socio-economic indicators.
- **Key Metrics:** Happiness Score, GDP per Capita, Social Support, Healthy Life Expectancy, Freedom, Generosity, and Perception of Corruption.
- **Major Findings:**
  - **North America and ANZ** emerged as the happiest region, while **South Asia** ranks the lowest.
  - **GDP per Capita** shows a strong positive correlation (**r = 0.78**) with happiness.
  - **Social Support (r = 0.72)** and **Life Expectancy (r = 0.69)** are also key contributors.
  - **Corruption Perception** has a weak negative correlation (**r = -0.31**) with happiness.
  - **43%** of countries had happiness scores above the global mean.
  - The top **10% happiest countries** have an average GDP **138.59% higher** than the bottom 10%.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Data Visualization** (Heatmaps, Pairplots, Correlation Matrices)
